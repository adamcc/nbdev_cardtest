<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This file will become your README and also the index of your
documentation.

Now you’re ready to create your documentation home page and README.md
file; these are both generated automatically from index.ipynb. Open the
Jupyter Notebook home page, then click on index.ipynb to open it.

We recommend including a longer description about what your package
does, how to install it, and how to use it (with a few examples which
import and use your package). Remember, examples can be code cells with
real outputs rather than plain markdown text.
